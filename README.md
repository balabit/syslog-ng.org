The [syslog-ng.org][sngo] website
=================================

This is the source of [syslog-ng.org][sngo]. To build it, you need to
have [Leiningen][lein] installed, and afterwards the static site is
buildable with the `lein build-site` command. The needed files are
`out/index.html` and `out/bundles/`, the rest is not used by the site.

To run a local server that serves the content and rebuilds
automatically, run `lein ring server-headless`.
